## The Marketing Reality Check

**Your question reframed:** "Do traders want to buy discipline coaching, or do they want to buy results?"

The answer is obvious: **They want results (money).** Nobody wakes up excited to be told they have an addiction problem.

But here's where your strategy docs actually have the answer buried in them:

---

## The Insight You Already Have (But Maybe Forgot)

From your competitive analysis conversation:

> "PropTraderAI is Dr. Frankenstein's Igor — the perfect executor. The trader is Frankenstein (the visionary). They bring the strategy, we handle everything else."

And the key positioning from PATH 1:

> **"90% of prop traders fail challenges due to execution failure, not strategy failure."**

This isn't selling discipline. This is selling **passing challenges.** The behavioral protection is **HOW** you deliver that result — not the result itself.

## The Marketing Reframe

| What PATH 2 Is (Internal) | What You SELL (External) |
|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| Behavioral Intelligence Layer | **Challenge Pass Rate** |
| Tilt Detection | **Saved you from a $2,000 mistake** |
| Revenge Trade Prevention | **Account Protection** |
| AA Sponsor Coaching | **You do the work, we stop you from blowing it** |

**The hero stat isn't "discipline streak: 4 days."**  
**The hero stat is "$3,200 in losses prevented this week."**

## My Suggestion on the Redesign

The marketing team's plan is good in principle but needs a **flip in emphasis:**

### Don't Lead With:
- "Behavioral protection"
- "Discipline coaching"
- "We stop you from yourself"
- "AA sponsor" voice upfront

### Lead With:
- **"Pass your prop challenge."** (the outcome they want)
- **"94% fail. You don't have to."** (fear + differentiation)
- **"Your strategy is good. Your execution isn't. We fix that."** (validate them, not shame them)
- **"$47,000 in losses prevented last month"** (social proof of results)

### THEN, Once They're In:
The dashboard CAN show discipline metrics, trade prevention, behavioral insights — but frame it as **"Here's how we protected your account"** not **"Here's your addiction score."**

## The Copy Shift

| Marketing Team's Draft | My Suggested Reframe |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| "We stop you from yourself" | "Your strategy executes perfectly, every time" |
| "Revenge trade prevention" | "We caught 3 bad setups before they cost you" |
| "Discipline streak: 4 days" | "$1,800 protected this week" |
| "You might be trading emotionally" | "This setup doesn't match your winning patterns" |

## The Bottom Line

**PATH 2 is your moat. It's NOT your headline.**

Traders buy results. The behavioral layer is the *mechanism* — it's why you deliver results better than competitors. But nobody buys "I need an AA sponsor." They buy "I want to pass my challenge and get funded."

**Sell the outcome. Deliver the mechanism.**
