# Marketing: Strategy, Content & Outreach

> **Last Updated:** January 16, 2026

## Overview

PropTraderAI's marketing focuses on **outcomes over features**. We sell passing challenges and getting funded, not "behavioral intelligence" or "AI execution."

**Key Insight:** Traders don't care about technology. They care about results.
