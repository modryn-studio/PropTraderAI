# Design: Brand, UX & Psychology

> **Last Updated:** January 16, 2026

## Overview

PropTraderAI's design philosophy is "Vibe-First, Power Later, Platform Last." We prioritize emotional resonance over feature density, especially in Phase 1.

**Core Principle:** PropTraderAI is not Headspace for traders. It's **AA sponsor meets sports psychologist meets risk manager**.

## Key Design Principles

### Phase 1: Vibe-Only Consumer App

1. **One thing at a time** — ONE hero card, everything else scrolls
2. **Default to hiding complexity** — If in doubt, don't show it
3. **Mobile-first always** — Desktop is secondary
4. **Frame protection as $ saved** — Not discipline, not willpower, MONEY

### Voice & Tone: "Protective but Respectful"

**We are NOT:**
- ❌ Gentle wellness app ("You might want to take a break? 🧘")
- ❌ Playful gamification ("Great job! 🎉")
- ❌ Judgmental parent ("You're being irresponsible!")

**We ARE:**
- ✅ Experienced trader who's been through it
- ✅ Sponsor who tells you the truth without shame
- ✅ Protective system that physically stops you when needed
