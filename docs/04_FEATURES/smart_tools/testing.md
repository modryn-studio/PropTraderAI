🎯 Testing Gaps

1. Tool appears when Claude asks "What's your risk per trade?" ✅ Should work (backend done)
2. Tool has prefilled account size if mentioned earlier ✅ Should work (extraction logic done)
3. User clicks "Use these values" ❌ Won't work yet (missing frontend handler)
4. Claude continues conversation after tool ❌ Won't work yet (missing backend processing)
5. Same tool doesn't appear twice ❌ Won't work yet (toolsShown not passed to backend)
6. User clicks "Let me type instead" ❌ Won't work yet (missing dismissal handler)
