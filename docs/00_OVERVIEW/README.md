# 00_OVERVIEW - Project Foundation

**Essential documents that define what PropTraderAI is and how we're building it.**

---

## 📄 Documents

### [build_specification.md](build_specification.md)
**The master specification document.**

Defines the complete product vision, technical architecture, and strategic framework.

**Covers:**
- Executive summary and market positioning
- The Three Core Paths (PATH 1, 2, 3)
- Technical architecture and component details
- User experience flows
- Data models and schemas
- Security and compliance requirements

**Read this to:** Understand the complete vision and why we're building what we're building.

---

### [roadmap.md](roadmap.md)
**Phase-by-phase implementation plan.**

Breaks down development into concrete milestones with clear deliverables.

**Phases:**
- **Phase 0** - Foundation (Tradovate validation, project setup)
- **Phase 1A** - PATH 1 Copilot Mode (Natural language + user-approved execution)
- **Phase 1B** - PATH 1 Autopilot Mode (24/7 autonomous execution)
- **Phase 2** - PATH 2 Behavioral Intelligence (Tilt detection, pattern learning)
- **Phase 3** - PATH 3 Platform Infrastructure (MCP servers, APIs, white-label)

**Read this to:** Know what we're building right now and what comes next.

## 🎯 Start Here

**New to the project?**

1. Read [build_specification.md](build_specification.md) (30 min) - Get the big picture
2. Read [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) (15 min) - Understand current phase
3. Jump to relevant PATH document in [../01_STRATEGY/](../01_STRATEGY/)

**Need quick reference?**

- What phase are we in? → Check [roadmap.md](roadmap.md)
- What's our moat? → PATH 2 in [build_specification.md](build_specification.md)
- What are we building this week? → Current phase in [roadmap.md](roadmap.md)

## 🔑 Key Insights from These Docs

### The Core Product Insight
> "PATH 2 (Behavioral Intelligence) is our actual product. PATH 1 (Execution) is just the delivery mechanism."

Competitors can copy features. They cannot copy years of behavioral data.

### The Marketing Insight
> "Sell the outcome (passing challenges), deliver the mechanism (behavioral protection)."

Traders buy results. The behavioral layer is why we deliver results better than competitors.

### The Technical Insight
> "PATH 1 requires a hybrid web architecture, not a pure web app."

Phase 1A: Pure web app with Copilot mode  
Phase 1B: Add execution server for Autopilot mode

## 📊 The Three Paths Framework

| Path | Name | Core Value | Priority |
|------|------|------------|----------|
| **PATH 1** | Autonomous Execution Engine | Natural language → AI trades for you | Phase 1A/1B |
| **PATH 2** | Behavioral Intelligence Layer | AI learns patterns, prevents self-sabotage | **THE MOAT** |
| **PATH 3** | Platform Infrastructure | MCP + APIs + white-label = others build on you | Phase 3+ |

## 🚨 Decision Filters

Before any product decision, apply these filters:

### Filter #1: Data Collection Priority
> "Does this help us collect more behavioral data faster?"

If yes → prioritize. If no → defer unless critical for PATH 1.

### Filter #2: Phase Alignment
> "Is this feature in the current phase?"

Phase 1 feature? Build it.  
Phase 2/3 feature? Don't build yet.

### Filter #3: Vibe-First UX
> "Does this add visible complexity?"

If yes → hide it. Phase 1 = aggressive simplicity.
