# TradersPost.io establishes clear market precedent for automated futures prop trading

Automated trading on futures prop firm accounts is an **established, legitimate market segment** with TradersPost.io as the dominant player, serving 40,000+ traders with $200M+ in connected accounts since 2021. The platform explicitly markets automation for prop firm evaluation and funded accounts, integrating with **29 futures prop firms** through Tradovate and ProjectX. However, a critical nuance exists: **prop firm automation policies vary dramatically**—some explicitly allow it (Topstep, MyFundedFutures), while others prohibit it entirely (Apex Trader Funding, Take Profit Trader). This creates both market validation and compliance complexity for similar offerings like PropTraderAI.

## TradersPost.io explicitly markets prop firm automation

TradersPost is a cloud-based, no-code trading automation platform founded in **January 2021** by Jonathan H. Wage in Nashville, Tennessee. The company has grown to execute **20M+ trades** across equities, options, futures, and crypto. Their prop firm focus is unmistakable—they maintain a dedicated marketing page with the headline: "TradersPost for Prop Firm Traders - Automate Your Prop Firm Trading."

Their marketing language explicitly targets both evaluation and funded accounts: "Execute trades across **evaluation and funded accounts** from firms like Topstep and Apex. TradersPost makes it easy to automate trading and manage multiple accounts from a single platform." The platform emphasizes parallel execution across "one signal, many prop accounts" and promotes eliminating manual execution to "avoid costly mistakes."

The technical workflow follows a straightforward pattern: TradingView or TrendSpider alerts trigger webhooks that TradersPost receives, parses, and routes to connected broker accounts (Tradovate, NinjaTrader, TradeStation, or ProjectX) for automated order execution. Typical latency is **1-2 seconds** from signal to execution. For prop firms specifically, traders can manage dozens of evaluation or funded accounts simultaneously from a single dashboard.

## 29 futures prop firms supported through two platforms

TradersPost integrates with prop firms through **Tradovate** (primary) and **ProjectX** ($29/mo additional subscription required). Their connections page lists the complete roster with comparison metrics:

The major firms with TradersPost integration include **Apex Trader Funding**, **Topstep**, **Take Profit Trader**, **My Funded Futures**, **Elite Trader Funding**, **Tradeify**, **TradeDay**, **Blue Guardian**, **Futures Elite**, and **TickTickTrader**, among 19 others. Each listing includes fee structure, profit targets, drawdown limits, consistency rules, and payout frequency—providing traders a comparison marketplace alongside the automation capability.

Pricing for TradersPost ranges from **$49/month** (1 live account) to **$299/month** (6 live accounts), with prop firm accounts counting toward the live account limit. Additional evaluation or sim accounts can be added for $5/month each.

## Prop firm automation policies diverge sharply

The most critical finding for any business entering this space: **automation policies vary dramatically between prop firms**, and TradersPost lists firms with opposing policies side-by-side.

### Firms that explicitly allow automated trading

**Topstep** stands as the most automation-friendly major prop firm, with official documentation stating: "Automated strategies can be used in the Trading Combine and Funded Accounts." They permit trade copiers and API access (TopstepX API at $29/month). Key restrictions: no VPS/VPN usage (must trade from personal device), no high-frequency trading, and Topstep provides zero support for automation troubleshooting.

**MyFundedFutures** updated their policy in **July 2025** to explicitly permit algorithmic trading: "Traders may make use of automated trading strategies tailored to their own specific settings so long as these automated tools do not aim to exploit the favorable fills offered in the Simulated Environment." They require active supervision, prohibit HFT (over 200 trades/day), and mandate CME compliance for live accounts.

**Tradeify** allows automation with ownership verification: "The use of automated trading bots or algorithms is permitted under the following conditions: the Trader must be able to prove that the Trader is the sole owner of the bot or strategy, and that no one else has access to or is using it." The bot must be used exclusively within Tradeify and cannot be deployed across multiple firms.

### Firms that explicitly prohibit automated trading

**Apex Trader Funding** maintains a strict prohibition: "The use of automation is strictly prohibited on PA and Live accounts. This includes any form of AI, Autobots, algorithms, fully automated trading systems, and high-frequency trading (HFTs)... Any type of hands-off, set-and-forget, or set-and-walk-away trading is strictly prohibited." They permit only semi-automated assistance for execution speed (like ATM strategies for stop-losses) while requiring active human intervention on all trades.

**Take Profit Trader** is equally restrictive: "We do not allow any automated or bot trading of any kind. All trades must be manually executed by the trader." This creates a notable discrepancy since TradersPost advertises integration with Take Profit Trader despite their automation prohibition.

## TradersPost shifts liability through clear disclaimers

TradersPost addresses the policy variation through comprehensive disclaimers that shift responsibility to traders: "Before linking TradersPost to any proprietary trading firm, you must verify that your trading approach complies with that firm's rules and restrictions. **TradersPost does not approve or encourage the use of our platform to circumvent, breach, or otherwise violate a prop firm's terms and conditions.**"

Their documentation explicitly warns: "Not all prop firms allow automated trading. Before paying evaluation fees, check the firm's terms and conditions to avoid disqualification. Some firms explicitly permit automation, while others may ban accounts using trade automation tools."

This liability structure allows TradersPost to maintain integrations with firms across the policy spectrum while protecting themselves legally. They position their service as providing "the tools" while traders "remain responsible for rule adherence."

## Company legitimacy and industry standing

TradersPost demonstrates strong legitimacy indicators: verified Delaware corporation registration, identifiable leadership with founder Jonathan Wage publicly visible in office hours and customer support, Trustpilot rating of **3.9/5** with 91% five-star reviews, partnerships with TrendSpider and LuxAlgo, and inclusion in TradingView's Learning Center. The platform is non-custodial (never holds customer funds), claims bank-level security with two-factor authentication, and maintains comprehensive documentation.

Minor concerns include small team size (6-10 employees) affecting support response times, a 7-day trial that includes weekends when markets are closed, and technical limitations like no automatic retry for failed orders. No significant red flags regarding fraud, unethical behavior, or unresolved complaints were found.

The competitive landscape includes PickMyTrade (direct TradingView-to-broker automation), Tradetron (multi-asset with strong options support), QuantVue ATS, and Alertatron. TradersPost differentiates through its prop firm focus, broader broker integration, and no-code approach.

## Market precedent implications for PropTraderAI

Several factors establish clear market precedent supporting a PropTraderAI offering:

First, **proven market demand exists**—TradersPost's 40,000+ users and $200M+ in connected accounts demonstrate substantial trader appetite for prop firm automation services. Their dedicated prop firm marketing, comparison tables, and multi-account execution features indicate this is a core use case, not an afterthought.

Second, **the industry is trending toward acceptance**. MyFundedFutures' July 2025 policy update explicitly permitting algorithmic trading signals a broader shift. The algorithmic trading market has grown approximately 70% over five years, and more prop firms are publishing clear automation policies.

Third, **the liability model is established**. TradersPost's approach—providing automation tools while requiring traders to verify individual firm policies and assuming full responsibility—creates a template for operating in this space without directly violating any firm's rules.

Fourth, **automation-friendly prop firms exist**. Topstep, MyFundedFutures, Tradeify, and FundedNext explicitly permit automated trading, providing legitimate target markets for automation services. A PropTraderAI offering could focus specifically on these firms or adopt TradersPost's broader approach with appropriate disclaimers.

## Key risks and considerations

The primary risk is the **policy divergence problem**—listing firms like Apex Trader Funding that prohibit automation could expose any service to accusations of facilitating rule violations, despite disclaimers. TradersPost's approach accepts this risk through liability disclaimers, but a more conservative approach would involve only integrating with firms that explicitly permit automation.

Universal prohibitions across virtually all firms include high-frequency trading, exploitation of simulation environment quirks, and copy trading between different traders. Any automation service must clearly communicate these boundaries.

## Conclusion

TradersPost.io has operated openly since 2021 providing exactly the service PropTraderAI contemplates—automated trading for futures prop firm accounts. Their success demonstrates market demand, while their disclaimer-based liability model provides a template for navigating varying firm policies. The critical insight is that this is not a gray area: it's an established market segment with a clear industry leader, specific prop firms that explicitly permit automation, and an evolving regulatory environment trending toward greater acceptance. PropTraderAI's offering would enter a validated market rather than creating a new category—the question is positioning strategy, particularly whether to integrate broadly (like TradersPost) or focus exclusively on automation-friendly firms to minimize compliance risk.
